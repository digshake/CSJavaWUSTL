Code Practice with Arrays
============================

* Find and open the ``StringMethods`` Java program
* Write the methods described below into the program.
* Call those methods from the main method and print out the results to check that your work is correct.
* An example has been completed for you already.

The methods you should write:

* A method that takes in a ``String`` and returns that string concatenated with itself. This one is completed for you.

* A method that takes in a ``String`` and an ``int n``, and returns n copies of the string concatenated together

* Now go back and rewrite your first method by having it call the second one.

* Take a look at Javaâ€™s `split <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#split(java.lang.String)>`_ method, that splits a ``String`` into an array containing the parts split by the specified regular expression.
	
	Here, assume the regular expression is simply " ", so that the input String is split into words.

* Write a method ``join(String[] array, String joiner)`` that is the inverse of split: it returns a single String with a copy of the joiner string between each part.

* Rewrite your second method in terms of this last one. To do this, create an array that has n copies of a given String, and then use your join method to concatenate them.
	
	Think about the string you want to appear between the copies, so that it appears the strings were concatenated together as before.
