**Introduction to Programming with Java** is designed to teach software application 
development using the Java programming language. 
This textbook includes an introduction to 2D graphics and animation. 
The material is organized into units that are flexible enough to support both objects-early and objects-late approaches.

**Introduction to Programming with Java** is an adaption of the **CS Awesome** book created by 
Dr. Beryl Hoffman, Associate Professor of Computer Science at Elms College, MA.
**CS Awesome** is a free AP CS A curriculum that was created in 2019 by adapting the AP CS A Java 
Review e-book written by Dr. Barbara Ericson, Assistant Professor of Information at University of Michigan. 
**Introduction to Programming with Java** was subsequently developed by Dr. Linda Seiter and Dr. Dan Palmer, 
Professors of Computer Science
at John Carroll University, to evolve the curriculum to be suitable for a college-level course.
