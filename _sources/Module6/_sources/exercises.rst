Module 6 Exercises
=====================



Exercise : 6.25. Recursive factorial and sum
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

* In the ``exercises6`` package of the ``exercises`` source folder, create

  * ``Sum.java`` as a Java class
  
  * ``SumTest.java`` as a JUnit test file
  
* Complete both so that sum is computed as defined by the explicitly recursive formula:

  :align: center



* Write some tests for ``sum()`` and run the unit test file to make sure your function works.


Remember that you have to have a ``@Test`` directive above any unit test method, as shown in the video.


Exercise : 6.27. Recursive addition
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

* In the ``exercises6`` package of the ``exercises`` source folder, complete the

  * ``Add.java``

  * ``addTest.java``

* Complete both so that addition is computed as defined by the explicitly recursive formula:

  :align: center




* Write some more tests for add and run the unit test file to make sure your function works.
  
* Remember that you have to have a ``@Test`` directive above any unit test method, as shown in the video.

* Under what conditions on x and y does your method operate correctly?

* How could you complete the ``addAll(x,y)`` method so it works for any ``x`` and ``y``?
  
See the code, as a hint is given there.




Exercise : 6.32. Base cases
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Part 1**

In the video, one possible explanation for human reproduction was given, namely that a woman is born with all of the babies already inside her that she would ever deliver. This idea is attributed to `Anton von Leeuwenhoek <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek>`_ who, as a lens maker, greatly advanced the use of microscopes in studying biology. In terms of recursion and base cases, what is wrong with von Leeuwenhoekâ€™s speculation?

**Part 2**

* In the ``exercises6`` package of the exercises source folder, find and open the ``FactorialNoBaseCase`` class.

* Run the class as a Java Application.

* What happens, and why?

Exercise : 6.55. Graph Paper
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

* In the ``exercises6`` package of the ``exercises`` source folder, find and open the ``GraphPaper`` class.

* Complete the class so that it produces a grid on the screen

* Think about the recursive substructure of drawing a grid

* Think about the base case(s)
