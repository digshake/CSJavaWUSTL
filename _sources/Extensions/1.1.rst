You will calculate the fine drivers have to pay when going over the speed limit in the state of Massachusetts according to the `Massachusetts DMV <http://www.dmv.org/ma-massachusetts/traffic-tickets.php>`_.

By completing this work, you demonstrate that you can:

* Create a Java class on your own
* Arrange for the class to take inputs of interest
* Compute output values of interest
* Produce meaningful output based on your computations

The objective of this extension is to allow you to practice **assignment statements** and **data types** as well as for you to create a practical tool, though of course we hope you never need to compute a speeding fine for yourself.

Consider the following story: 

* Pat is driving a Mini Cooper at 85 MPH on a road that has the speed limit of 60 MPH.
* Pat is therefore going 25 MPH over the speed limit.
* If Pat is caught speeding, what would be Pat's fine?  

We'll model the fine after Massachusetts law:

* A fine is assessed only if the driver's speed is over the speed limit.
* The fine is $10 for every mile over the speed limit, but there is a $100 minimum fine.
* Example: If someone is going 75 MPH on a road with a speed limit of 60 MPH, the fine would be 15*$10 = $150.
* Example: If someone is going 65 MPH on a road with a speed limit of 60 MPH, the fine would be $100.
 
Procedure
==================


1. First, create a **SpeedLimit** Java class in the ``speeding`` package of the ``extensions`` source folder.
2. Consider and decide upon the **data type** to represent information of interest to this problem.
3. You must ask the user for some input values. Use 
4. Arrange for your program to produce output such that:
   * If the driver is going at or under the speed limit, the fine is $0.
   * If the driver is going less than 10 miles over the speed limit, the fine is $100.
   * If the driver is going over 10 miles over the speed limit, the fine is 10 times the number of miles over the speed limit.
   
	> Beware: Make sure your program works correctly for 0 MPH and all possible positive speeds.
5. Finally, your program should print how many miles you were going over the speed limit and how much money the fine will be.

Sample output based on the example story above:

::

	You reported a speed of 85 MPH for a speed limit of 60 MPH.
	You went 25 MPH over the speed limit.
	Your fine is $250.


You must compute the required information **without** using `if`-statements.  To evaluate an expression conditionally, use the `ternary <http://alvinalexander.com/java/edu/pj/pj010018>`_ operator, an example of which follows:

::
	
	int x = (y > 7) ? 12 : 5;


The variable ``x`` is set to ``12`` if ``y``'s value is greater than ``7``;  otherwise ``x`` is set to ``5``.
