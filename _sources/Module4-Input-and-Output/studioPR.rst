Studio PR: Peer Review
=====================

**Studio activities should not be started before class! Come to the session and work on the activity with other students!**

Studio Setup and Procedure
=====================

Unlike previous studios, you will not be working on a new problem. Rather, we will go through an exercise called Peer Review. Like many disciplince, computing often requires many people to work together to solve large, complex problems. Humans are prone to mistakes and biases, however, so by performing regular peer reviews we gain the perspective of others on our code which may catch problems that were otherwise missed. The act of peer review is very common in industry and professional programmers are regularly expected to have their code reviewed by their peers as well as to review their peers' code submissions.

For this peer review we want you to focus specifically on the style of the code. While there is some flexibility in how you can write your code, keeping your code files clean and consistent will make it easier for others to understand what your code is doing.

1. Once you have formed a group, review the `Google Java Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html>`_ with your group. You do not have to become familiar with the entire style guide, rather for today you should focus on three areas: **brackets**, **whitespace** (tabs, spacing, new lines, etc.), and **variable names**. Make sure you understand what the style guide says about these areas before proceeding.

2. **Select one group member and have them display their Nim code from assignment 2.** Your group should review this code and make sure that it conforms to the style guidlines, fixing any issues as they appear.

3. Repeat this process for every member in your group.

**To demo this studio:** You must show your cleaned up Nim programs to an instructor or a TA. **All members of the group must pass the style inspection before the group can be checked out!** Be sure to help your peers fix up their code as well!
