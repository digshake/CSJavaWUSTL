The new AP CS A Labs released in 2019, the |Celebrity Lab| (Activity 1-3) and the |Data Lab| (Activity 1 and 2 but not 3), are for students to practice writing classes. The teacher guide and the code files are available in the AP Course Audit Portal. This page will eventually include tips to complete the labs.
