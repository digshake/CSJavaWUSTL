Mixed Up Code Practice
===============================

The coding problems below are mostly about Strings, but more problems on other topics in this unit will be added in the future.



Try to solve each of the following. Click the *Check Me* button to check each solution.  You will be told if your solution is too short, has a block in the wrong order, or you are using the wrong block.  Some of the problems have an extra block that isn't needed in the correct solution.

   The main method in the following class should print a random number from 1 to 50. But, the blocks have been mixed up and may include an extra block that isn't needed in the solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
