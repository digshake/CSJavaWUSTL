# Background

In this extension we will use StdDraw to create a method that draws stars with any given odd number of points at any given rotation angle.

* [Trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions) 

* [Math.cos(angleInRadians)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#cos(double))

* [Math.sin(angleInRadians)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#sin(double))

* [StdDraw.filledPolygon(xs, ys)](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html#filledPolygon-double:A-double:A-)

## Polar Coordinates

It may be useful to think about how you convert from [polar coordinates](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolarCoordinates.html) (&rho;, &theta;) to [cartesian coordinates](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CartesianCoordinates.html) (x, y) to aid you in how you tackle this problem.

## Filled Polygon

For a demo on how to use `StdDraw.filledPolygon(xs, ys)` check out this video:

Code from the video:

~~~java
		double[] xs = {0.1, 0.9, 0.5, 0.3, 0.6};
		double[] ys = {0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.05};
		StdDraw.filledPolygon(xs, ys);
~~~

# Procedure

A clean, elegant solution is desirable and achievable to this extension.  You should require only `Math.cos(radians)`, `Math.sin(radians)`, `StdDraw.filledPolygon(xs, ys)`, and a single loop.  

**Note:** Credit will only be awarded for clean, elegant solutions.

**Recall From High School Trigonometry:**  you can get the x-coordinate of a point on the unit (radius 1) circle at an angle theta with `Math.cos(thetaInRadians)`.  You can get the y-coordinate with `Math.sin(thetaInRadians)`.

## Plan

Perhaps you recall drawing a five pointed star as a child:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/resources/extensions/5.06/star_5_draw_order.png" width="320">

Note: There is nothing wrong with the [drawing-10-points-for-a-5-pointed-star technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R_WdZh0WPs).  This technique will also work.  However, it is likely that the 5-points-for-a-5-pointed-star technique is cleaner and easier.

Look at the images below for 3, 5, and 7 pointed stars.  Come up with a plan to fill odd pointed stars

**3 Pointed Star (a.k.a. Equilateral Triangle)**

**5 Pointed Star**

**7 Pointed Star**

## Demo Video
In the video below, Prof Cosgrove discusses:
- Definition for revolution: how many full circles the pen tip travelled while drawing a star (the process of drawing a star, see the second video).
- How to test your code
- What correct stars look like
- How it is used in flags

## How Many Revolutions?

How many complete revolutions will a 3 pointed star require?  A 5 pointed star?  A 7 pointed star?  A 9 pointed star? ...

Implement the method `calculateRevolutionsForPoints(numPoints)`

**Note:** Be sure to delete the `throw new NotYetImplementedException();` line.

~~~java
private static double calculateRevolutionsForPoints(int numPoints) {
	// Delete the line below and implement this method
	throw new NotYetImplementedException();
}
~~~

## Inspect calculateTotalThetaInRadians

Revolutions might be the right unit to think about how many times around the circle you need to go for a particular pointed star.  [Math.cos(angleInRadians)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#cos(double)) and [Math.sin(angleInRadians)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#sin(double)) are specified in radians.  This method will convert from revolutions to radians for you.

## Fill Odd Pointed Star

Note the provided lines in `filledOddPointedStar(xCenter, yCenter, radius, numPoints, theta0InRadians)`.  You can count on the fact that `nPoints` is odd and at least 3.

~~~java
public static void filledOddPointedStar(double xCenter, double yCenter, double radius, 
		int numPoints, double theta0InRadians) {
	if (numPoints % 2 == 0) {
		throw new IllegalArgumentException();
	}
	if (numPoints < 3) {
		throw new IllegalArgumentException();
	}
	//
	// FIXME Your code goes here
	//
}
~~~

Implement your clean, elegant solution to this problem.  If you find yourself with if statements handling the different number of points separately you are on the wrong path and will **NOT** receive credit for this extension.

# Testing

## Star

Run `Star.java` as a Java Program.

You should see a spinning trinagle, and be prompted to continue.  Then a smaller triangle in a different location, and another prompt.  Then a 5 pointed star...

**Note:** See demo video above.

## Singapore Flag

Inspect `SingaporeFlag.java`.  Note that we take advantage of the fact that we can use the Flag of Indonesia (which in turn can use the Mother of All Flags, Norway).

Ask yourself: 

* How is the crescent created?
* How are the stars placed?

Run `SingaporeFlag.java` as a Java Program.

## Australian Flag Minus Union Jack

Inspect `AustraliaFlagMinusUnionJack.java`.  Note the different number pointed stars.

Run `AustraliaFlagMinusUnionJack.java` as a Java Program.
