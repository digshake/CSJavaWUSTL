First Day!
=====================

Your primary objective for the first day is to complete the `the software installation and setup <software.html>`_. TAs and the instructor will be available in the labs if you need assistance.

The next class period will be studio 0, an in-class, group-work activity. In the meantime you could begin `Assignment 0 <assignment.html>`_ which is due early next week (see Canvas for exact due date) or start the prep work for Module 1 (found on the Canvas home page).
