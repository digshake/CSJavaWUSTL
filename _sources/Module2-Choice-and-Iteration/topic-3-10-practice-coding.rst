Coding Practice 
==============================

   
   
              The ``Test1`` program should generate a random number and print if it is evenly divisible by 2.  However, the code has an error and always prints "Your number is even", even if the random number is odd.
              Fix the code so that it only prints the message when the number is even.
   
              The ``Test2`` program should check your guess against the answer and print that it is too low, correct, or too high.  However, the code has errors.  Fix the code so that it compiles and runs correctly.      
                         
              The ``Test3`` program should print "You can go out" if you have done your homework and cleaned your room. However, the code has errors.  Fix the code so that it compiles and runs correctly.  
              
                         
              The ``Test4`` program should print if x is in the range of 0 to 10 (including 0 and 10). However, the code has errors.  Fix the errors so that the code runs as intended.
               
                         
              The ``Test5`` program should print if x is less than 0, equal to 0, or greater than 0.  Finish it to work correctly.  
   
              Finish the ``Test6`` program so that it prints ``You can go out`` if you have a ride or if you can walk and otherwise prints ``You can't go out``.  Use a logical or to create a complex conditional. 
   
              Finish the ``Test7`` program to print you can go out if you don't have homework and you have done the dishes.
              
     
              Finish the ``Test8`` program so that it prints ``You have a fever`` if your temperature is above 100 and otherwise prints ``You don't have a fever``. 
   
              Finish the ``Test9`` program to print ``It is freezing`` if the temperature is below 30, ``It is cold`` if it is below 50, ``It is nice out`` if it is below 90, or ``It is hot`` using nested if else statements. 
            
          
   
              Rewrite the ``Loop1`` program to use a ``while`` loop instead of a ``for`` loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
             
                         
              Rewrite the ``Loop2`` program so that it uses a ``for`` loop instead of a ``while`` loop to print out all the integers from 5 to 15 (inclusive).  
              
                         
              Rewrite the ``Loop3`` program to use a ``while`` loop instead of a ``for`` loop to print out the numbers from 10 to 100 by 10's (inclusive).
              
              
              The ``Loop4`` program should print the values from 1 to 10 (inclusive) but has errors.  Fix the errors so that the code works as intended. If the code is in an infinite loop you can refresh the page in the browser to stop the loop and then click on Load History and move the bar above it to see your last changes.
              
   
              The ``Loop5`` program should print the values from 10 to 5, but it has errors.  Fix the errors so that the code works as intended.
              
   
              The ``Loop6`` program should print the values from 10 to 1, but it has errors.  Fix the errors so that the code works as intended.
   
              Finish ``Loop7`` program to print a countdown from 100 to 0 by 10's using a for or while loop.
                
  
              Finish the ``Loop8`` program to print the value of ``x`` and ``" is even"`` if ``x`` is even and ``" is odd"`` if it is odd for all values from 10 to 1. 
              
     
              Finish the ``Loop9`` program to print the values for ``10 * x`` where ``x`` changes from 0 to 10 using a loop.
              
  
              Finish the ``Loop10`` program so that it prints a string message minus the last character 
              each time through the loop until there are no more characters in message.   
              The loop condition should test the length of the message.
              The loop body should print the message and then use substring to create a new message without the last character.  
   
              Finish ``Loop11`` program to loop printing the message each time through the loop and remove an ``x`` from the message until all the ``x``'s are gone. 
  
              Write a loop in the ``Loop12`` program to print the number of ``x``'s in the string message.  Use the ``indexOf`` and ``substring`` methods.
              
   
              Write the ``Loop13`` program to print a rectangle of stars (``*``) with 5 rows of stars and 3 stars per row. Hint: use nested for loops.
              
   
              Write the ``Loop14`` program to print a rectangle of stars (``*``) with 3 rows of stars and 5 stars per row. 
              
   
              Write the ``Loop15`` program to print 55555, 4444, 333, 22, 1 with each on a different line.
