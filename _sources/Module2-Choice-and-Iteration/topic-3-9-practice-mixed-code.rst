Mixed Up Code Practice
======================

Try to solve each of the following. Click the *Check* button to check each solution.  
You will be told if your solution is too short, has a block in the wrong order, 
or you are using the wrong block.  Some of the problems have an extra block or 
two that aren't needed in the correct solution.
