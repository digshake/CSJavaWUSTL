Exercise : 1.40. Making change
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For this exercise it is not so important that you get the exercise exactly right. It is important to work through it as best you can before you look at the solution or continue with other work in this module.

You have some number of pennies, and you would like to determine how to make change for those pennies to obtain the proper number of each of the following currencies:

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Currency
     - Pennies
   * - dollar
     - 100
   * - quarter
     - 25
   * - dime
     - 10
   * - nickel
     - 5

| In making change, we seek the maximum number of each denomination in decreasing order. For example, given **798** pennies, your program should print the following

| ``For 798 pennies:``
| ``7 dollars``
| ``3 quarters``
| ``2 dimes``
| ``0 nickels``
| ``3 pennies``


**Instructions**

* Add code to prompt users for number of pennies

* Compute and print the output as suggested above.

* Good luck!


**Hints**

* You need to use integer division and remainder (%) to complete this exercise.

* Review the video materials as necessary for this module.

* Follow the execution of your code
