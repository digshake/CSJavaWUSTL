The |Picture Lab| is a fun lab that you started in 8.2 and could finish now. There is also a new College Board 2019 extension of this lab called the |Steganography lab|. The teacher guide and the code files are available in the AP Course Audit Portal. This page will eventually include tips to complete the labs.
